# Multicore Programming - Homework 1

This repository contains the solution for Homework 1 of the **CS 435/535 – Fall 2024** course, focused on multicore programming concepts. The main objective of this project is to implement and analyze serial and parallel versions of the Sobel filter algorithm.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **`sobel_seq.c`**: Serial implementation of the Sobel filter.
- **`sobel_par.c`**: Parallel implementation of the Sobel filter using pthreads.
- **`Makefile`**: Build script for compiling the code.
- **`hw1.pdf`**: Homework instructions and guidelines.
- **Input/Output Images**: Example input and output images for testing the Sobel filter implementations.

## Requirements

### Software
- **Linux/Unix-based OS** (required for compatibility with provided tools).
- **C Compiler**: GCC or compatible.
- **Profiler Tools**:
  - Intel Vtune (preferred for x86 architecture).
  - Other profiling tools like `likwid` or `gprof`.

### Dependencies
- Install the required profiler tools:
  - [Intel Vtune](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/vtune-profiler/get-started-guide/2024-2/linux-os.html)
  - [likwid](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid)

## Compilation

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will generate two executable files:
- `sobel_seq`: Serial implementation.
- `sobel_par`: Parallel implementation.

## Usage

### Serial Version
Run the serial version of the Sobel filter using:

```bash
./sobel_seq <input_image>
```

### Parallel Version
Run the parallel version with a specified number of threads:

```bash
./sobel_par <input_image> <num_threads>
```

Example:
```bash
./sobel_par input.jpg 4
```

## Tasks and Analysis

The homework involves the following tasks:

1. **System Setup**:
   - Install profiling tools and analyze the CPU topology using tools like `lscpu` or `likwid-topology`.

2. **Serial Implementation Analysis**:
   - Profile the serial version (`sobel_seq.c`) to analyze:
     - Hotspots (time spent in different parts of the code).
     - Memory consumption.
     - Cache performance and memory bandwidth.

3. **Parallel Implementation**:
   - Implement parallelism in `sobel_par.c` using pthreads.
   - Use command-line arguments to specify the number of threads.

4. **Parallel Implementation Analysis**:
   - Perform profiling for the parallel version with different thread counts (2, 4, 8, 16, 32).
   - Analyze:
     - Time spent in functions (hotspots).
     - Threading efficiency.
     - Cache and memory performance.

## Example Input/Output

Input and output images for testing are provided in the repository. Use these images to validate the correctness of your implementation.

## Notes

- Ensure to comment on the modifications in `sobel_par.c` for clarity.
- Follow the guidelines provided in `hw1.pdf` for detailed analysis and reporting.
