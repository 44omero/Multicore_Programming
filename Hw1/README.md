# Homework 1: Multicore Programming

This folder contains the first assignment for the **Multicore Programming** course. The assignment demonstrates the implementation of a specific parallel programming concept using multicore and multithreaded techniques.

## üìÇ Contents

- **`source_code/`**: Main source files for the assignment.
- **`input_data/`**: Sample input data files used for testing.
- **`output_data/`**: Output files generated by the program.
- **`Makefile`**: A makefile to facilitate building and running the program.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the assignment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently utilizes multicore systems for parallel task execution.
- **Scalable Design**: Adapts dynamically to different numbers of threads or cores.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimizes synchronization overhead and maximizes computational efficiency.

## üîß Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC) with support for multithreading (`pthread` library).
- `make` utility for building the program.
- A Unix/Linux-based operating system is recommended for optimal performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/44omero/Multicore_Programming.git
   cd Multicore_Programming/Hw1
2. Build the program:
   ```bash
   make
## üöÄ Usage

Run the program using the following syntax:
   ```bash
  ./program_name <input_file> <number_of_threads> 
```
<input_file>: Path to the input data file.
<number_of_threads>: Number of threads to use for execution.

Example
```bash
./program_name input_data/sample.txt 4
```
This command will execute the program with 4 threads and use sample.txt as the input file. The output will be saved in the output_data/ directory.
